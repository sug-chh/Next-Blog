## Its a simple blog built with NextJS, Markdown and Tailwind Css.
Next-Blog is a very simple and minimalistic blog website built with NextJs. One can simply add a .md file in posts folder to create posts. The filename will be used a slug. It uses a package called gray-matter to parse the contents inside .md file into its constituent frontmatter (which consists of all javascript object data including title, date, excerpt, cover_image and so on) and content (which consists of the main body of the blog written in markdown).
